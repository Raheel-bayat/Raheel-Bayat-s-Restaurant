                <b>Instructions</b>
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b> In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, mix flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic (about 8-10 minutes). Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise for about 1 hour in a warm place, until it doubles in size.</li>
                    <li><b>Preheat the Oven:</b> Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F). Place a pizza stone or baking tray inside to heat.</li>
                    <li><b>Prepare the Toppings:</b> Slice the tomato thinly and prepare the pineapple chunks. Set them aside. If using fresh tomato sauce, season it with a little salt, pepper, and olive oil for extra flavor.</li>
                    <li><b>Assemble the Pizza:</b> Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer it to parchment paper. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Arrange the pineapple chunks and tomato slices on top. Drizzle lightly with olive oil.</li>
                    <li><b>Bake the Pizza:</b> Carefully transfer the pizza (on parchment paper) to the preheated pizza stone or tray in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
                    <li><b>Garnish and Serve:</b> Remove the pizza from the oven. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired. Slice and enjoy your delicious homemade Italian pizza with pineapple and tomato!</li>
